# hide-vs-menu [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6vdl148i0gx6jni9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nil4/hide-vs-menu)

An extension for Visual Studio 2017 and later that hides the main menubar until the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key is pressed, 
saving a bit of screen space.

Based on a similar [extension by Microsoft (Matthew Johnson)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MatthewJohnsonMSFT.HideMainMenu) 
that was last updated for VS 2015 compatibility, and later abandoned.
